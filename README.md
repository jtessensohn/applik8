applik8 is a tool for job hunters to store their applications in one convenient place. applik8 includes fields for relevant information such as company, job title, date applied, and a potential follow up date. Features editing and deletion.

applik8 also pulls salary data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and runs them through our formula to project and 0-15 year estimation of salary for potential job titles. Users can also 'plot' years on a graph of job titles they may have had to see where they have been and where they want to go.
